# Python-PasswordCracker
Cracks Simple MD5 Hashed Passwords

The script utilizes the brute force approach to crack simple MD5 hashed passwords
Hashed passwords are stored in the Hashed.txt file in the folder
The script is developed for a college level cyber security course
The script will only work for hashes stored in the Hashed.txt folder right now

Changes need to be made if you want the script to crack other hashes (passwords which have different lengths than those in the .txt file)
